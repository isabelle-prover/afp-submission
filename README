AFP submission system
=====================

This is the automated AFP submission system.

Architecture
------------

The submission system is split into two parts:

 * the submission management (bin/server)

 * the execution environment for each single submission (LXC container)

The web interface is implemented in AFP/Scala and puts the submitted AFP theory into
UPLOAD_DIR. The submission management regularly scans this directory and
starts a new execution environment for each new submission. The results of this
run are stored in DOWNLOAD_DIR.

Install
-------

 * this directory should be found under /opt/afpbuild

 * src/config.py contains setup for paths, email adresses etc...

 * bin/server is the submission management

 * /var/afpbuild/up, /var/afpbuild/up is the submission database

Development Environment
-----------------------

Running SMTP catcher:
  sudo python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:25

  Prints out all emails sent to localhost:25

Setup the LXC container:

  Before downloading up the container. Be aware that we do not use the default
  configuration from "/etc/lxc/default.conf", this only would setup networking
  which we want to avoid. For more information look in the ansible setup in
  isabelle-cl by Lars.

  # ~/.config/lxc/default.conf
  lxc.id_map = u 0 10000001 10000
  lxc.id_map = g 0 10000001 10000
